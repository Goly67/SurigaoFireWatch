/**
 * HISTORICAL FIRES — real, sourced incidents (not sample data).
 *
 * Unlike surigao.js's seedReports (fabricated demo pins), every entry here is
 * built from published reporting or a local-government document. Locations
 * are placed at the barangay/purok level, NOT a verified street address —
 * exact lot-level coordinates for a purok are not published anywhere public,
 * so `location` is the nearest confident anchor point and `locationNote`
 * says so plainly. Re-geocode before treating a pin as authoritative.
 *
 * Add new fires here as they're documented. Each needs at least one source.
